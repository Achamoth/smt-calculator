- Restyle table a bit (make it look nicer)
- Better background colors (fix divs to make this consistent everywhere)
- Add demon stats and affinities to table, ability to sort by any header
- Add customization for fusion recipe
    - Max level for any demon in recipe
    - Exclude any demons from recipe
    - Should probably perform some validation checks to make sure the recipe can be generated at all
    - Timeout after one minute?
    - Find a way to prevent thread from blocking?
- Fix component recipe generation (seems to just break after enough components are added)
